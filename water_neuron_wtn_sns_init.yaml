    # Configuration of the vesting schedule of the neuron basket, i.e., the SNS
    # neurons that a participants will receive from a successful
    # decentralization swap.
    VestingSchedule:
        # The number of events in the vesting schedule. This translates to how
        # many neurons will be in each participant's neuron basket. Note that
        # the first neuron in each neuron basket will have zero dissolve delay.
        # This value should thus be greater than or equal to `2`.
        events: 5

        # The interval at which the schedule will be increased per event. The
        # first neuron in the basket will be unlocked with zero dissolve delay.
        # Each other neuron in the schedule will have its dissolve delay
        # increased by `interval` compared to the previous one. For example,
        # if `events` is set to `3` and `interval` is `1 month`, then each
        # participant's neuron basket will have three neurons (with equal stake)
        # with dissolve delays zero, 1 month, and 2 months. Note that the notion
        # of `Distribution.neurons.vesting_period` applies only to developer
        # neurons. While neuron basket neurons do not use `vesting_period`, they
        # have a vesting schedule. This field is specified as a duration. For
        # example: "1 month".
        interval: 6 months

    # Absolute time of day when the decentralization swap is supposed to start.
    #
    # An algorithm will be applied to allow at least 24 hours between the time
    # of execution of the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal and swap start.
    # For example, if start_time is 23:30 UTC and the proposal is adopted and
    # executed at 23:20 UTC, then the swap start will be at 23:30 UTC the next
    # day (i.e., in 24 hours and 10 min from the proposal execution time).
    #
    # WARNING: Swap start_time works differently on mainnet and in testing.
    #
    # On mainnet:
    # - Setting start_time to some value (e.g., 23:30 UTC) will allow the swap
    #   participants to be prepared for the swap in advance, e.g.,
    #   by obtaining ICPs that they would like to participate with.
    # - If start_time is not specified, the actual start time of the swap will
    #   be chosen at random (allowing at least 24 hours and less than 48 hours,
    #   as described above).
    #
    # In testing:
    # - Setting start_time to some value works the same as explained above.
    # - If start_time is not specified, the swap will begin immediately after
    #   the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal is executed. This facilitates
    #   testing in an accelerated manner.
    #
    start_time: 16:00UTC   # Intentionally commented out for testing.

    # The duration of the decentralization swap. When `start_time` is calculated
    # during CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal execution, this `duration` will
    # be added to that absolute time and set as the swap's deadline.
    duration: 14 days
